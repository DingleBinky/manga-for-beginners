# 10 Manga for beginners

 Introduction

 My name is Roma, this is my first project for Code Institute, reading manga has always been a favorite passtime of mine, it has consistently helped me with my mental health and has brought me most of the joy in my adult life which is the reason I decided to make this my project. With this website I aim to give newcomers a variety of incredible manga so that they too can come to appreciate and love manga as I do.
