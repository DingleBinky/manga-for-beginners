# 10 Manga for beginners

## Introduction

This is my first project for Code Institute. Reading manga has always been a favorite passtime of mine, it has consistently helped me with my mental health and has brought me most of the joy in my adult life which is the reason I decided to make this my project. With this website I aim to give newcomers a variety of incredible manga so that they too can come to appreciate and love manga as I do.

## Website Goals

### User Goals

* Introduce newcomers to manga
* Get involved with suggestions and feedback

### Author Goals

* Gain experience in creating and designing a website
* Achieve a pass or higher for the first project for Code Institute

## Design

My original design was to go with a comic style background with some manga panels which was changed later to a basic parchment background because the manga panels made the screen look cluttered, I was gonna go for a gray transparent background with white text for the main component of the website but later changed it to a black transparent background as it was easier on the eyes. I created 2 sides for the list of manga to minimize the amount of scrolling, on smaller screens this was unavoidable

## Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS

## Challenges

I had a problem with my footer as it was stuck to the right side underneath my right float, this was because my left float was bigger than the right so to fix
this issue I switched 2 manga around from both floats to balance out the sides, originally One Piece was #10 and Solo Levelling was #5 since One Piece had the most amount of text it seemed the logical choice to switch with another.

## Credits

I used some code from Love Running to help with my footer.

I used some code from <https://dirask.com/posts/CSS-disable-background-image-scrolling-1bGZlD> to help me fix up my background image from going off the page.

I used code from Love Running to help me with the start of the Suggestion page.

I used code from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11315570/align-radio-button-one-below-the-other> to help me better arrange my buttons for the feedback part of the Suggestion page.
