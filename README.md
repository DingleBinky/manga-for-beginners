# 10 Manga for beginners

## Introduction

This is my first project for Code Institute. Reading manga has always been a favorite passtime of mine, it has consistently helped me with my mental health and has brought me most of the joy in my adult life which is the reason I decided to make this my project. With this website I aim to give newcomers a variety of incredible manga so that they too can come to appreciate and love manga as I do.

## Website Goals

### User Goals

* Introduce newcomers to manga
* Get involved with suggestions and feedback

### Author Goals

* Gain experience in creating and designing a website
* Achieve a pass or higher for the first project for Code Institute

## Design

My original design was to go with a comic style background with some manga panels which was changed later to a basic parchment background because the manga panels made the screen look cluttered, I was gonna go for a gray transparent background with white text for the main component of the website but later changed it to a black transparent background as it was easier on the eyes. I created 2 sides for the list of manga to minimize the amount of scrolling, on smaller screens this was unavoidable

## Features

### Index

The home page is the main component of the website, it contains the manga I chose to use as the purpose of the website. Each manga on the list has my best attempt at a brief explanation of them and an accompanying image to give each manga a feeling of variety and how much each one differs from the other.

### Gallery

I decided to create a gallery page as a sort of extension for each manga, so that people can have a look at a number of art before or after they decide to read the home page. Art is a big part of manga, and since humans devour with their eye, I thought a gallery page would be a good addition or alternative.

### Suggestion/Feedback

There are thousands of different manga out there and I have not come close to reading them all, therefore I created this suggestion page for those with recommendations who would be inclined to share them and asd more variety to the website as time goes on and I have also added an optional feedback section for the purposes of determining if the website has helped people.

## Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS
* Snipping Tool

## Challenges

I had a problem with my footer as it was stuck to the right side underneath my right float, this was because my left float was bigger than the right so to fix
this issue I switched 2 manga around from both floats to balance out the sides, originally One Piece was #10 and Solo Levelling was #5 since One Piece had the most amount of text it seemed the logical choice to switch with another.

I had a problem with my background image. On the index page it would be zoomed in a blurred and I did not know how to fix this as it was using the same CSS as the other pages but the other pages did not have this problem, so I searched for a solution on google and came across a piece of code that fixed my issue (I have put a link to the codes origin in the credits).

## Credits
