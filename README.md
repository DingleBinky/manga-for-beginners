# 10 Manga for beginners

## Introduction

This is my first project for Code Institute. Reading manga has always been a favorite passtime of mine, it has consistently helped me with my mental health and has brought me most of the joy in my adult life which is the reason I decided to make this my project. With this website I aim to give newcomers a variety of incredible manga so that they too can come to appreciate and love manga as I do.

## Website Goals

### User Goals

* Introduce newcomers to manga
* Get involved with suggestions and feedback

### Author Goals

* Gain experience in creating and designing a website
* Achieve a pass or higher for the first project for Code Institute

## Design

My original design was to go with a comic style background with some manga panels which was changed later to a basic parchment background because the manga panels made the screen look cluttered, I was gonna go for a gray transparent background with white text for the main component of the website but later changed it to a black transparent background as it was easier on the eyes. I created 2 sides for the list of manga to minimize the amount of scrolling, on smaller screens this was unavoidable

## Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS

## Credits

I used some code from Love Running to help fix my footer issue
