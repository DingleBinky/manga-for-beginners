                My name is Roma Akmentins. Manga is a big part of my life and is responsible for a large portion of my happiness,
                all of the stories I have read contributed to a lot of my stress relief and all of the hard and depressing moments
                of my life and continue to help to this day, this has led to the creation of this website. My goal is to help
                newcomers with choosing a manga from a range of beginner friendly and engaging list of stories to get immersed in.

                    <p>
                        One Piece is my favorite manga of all time and it is also the longest manga on this list with over
                        a thousand chapters and it is still ongoing. One Piece is a very diverse manga with very strong
                        world building. The character design in this manga has a lot of variety with a lot of goofy aspects
                        and very unique personalities. The manga follows a boy named Luffy who is extremely determined to
                        become the "Pirate King", he sets off from his village to amass a crew. Meeting so many different
                        quirky people he slowly gains trusted companions who he treats like family. This is a long manga
                        but I highly recommend it as it is one of the most unique mangas on this list with so much to offer.
