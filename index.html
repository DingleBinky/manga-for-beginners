    <h2>10. One Piece</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/one-piece.jpg" alt="Protagonist with his crew" class="center">
    <p>
        One Piece is my favorite manga of all time and it is also the longest manga on this list with over a thousand chapters and it is still ongoing. One Piece is a very diverse manga with very strong world building. The character design in this manga has a lot of variety with a lot of goofy aspects and very unique personalities. The manga follows a boy named Luffy who is extremely determined to become the "Pirate King", he sets off from his village to amass a crew. Meeting so many different quirky people he slowly gains trusted companions who he treats like family. This is a long manga but I highly recommend it as it is one of the most unique mangas on this list with so much to offer.
